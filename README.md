# V3 - mindustry V7 support
## Additions
* Makes the game more challenging
* Not designed for campaign: you need fuel for furnaces and basalt - to make them in the first place
#### Raw resources
* Now Copper/Lead/Titanium ore drops **raw Copper/Lead/Titanium** which have to be **smelted** in furnaces
#### Basalt
* Item that drops from basalt or hot rock tiles or basalt ore
* Required to make furnaces and walls
#### Sulfur
* Item made from oil (similar to oil centrifuge)
* New item required to make **pyratite** (instead of lead) and **large batteries** (small batteries are unaffected)
#### Acid
* Liquid made from sulfur and water
* Use as ammo - similar to slug, but it's status effect deals **more damage** than melting
* Use in Electric Furnace to **double** the output per ore!
